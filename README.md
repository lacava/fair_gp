# Fair GP

This repo contains code to reproduce the experiments in the paper

La Cava, W. and Moore, J.H. (2020). 
"Genetic programming approaches to learning fair classifiers."
GECCO 2020.
[doi:10.1145/3377930.3390157](https://doi.org/10.1145/3377930.3390157),

## reproducing the experiments

The experiments can be run by navigating to `analysis/` and running

```
python submit_jobs.py
```

check out `submit_jobs.py` to get help on configuration.

## figures

The summary figures are generated in `hypervolume_comparison.ipynb`, and 
the stats tests are in `stats.ipynb`. 

Pareto front comparisons are generated by `pareto_front_plots.ipynb`. 

# References

Aside from the usual (sklearn etc.), we make heavy use of the

repository and its associated work (https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05144,

Hypervolume calculations come from [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap)

The GP models are based on [feat](https://github.com/lacava/feat)
