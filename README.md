## reproducing the experiments

The experiments can be run by navigating to `analysis/` and running

```
python submit_jobs.py
```

check out `submit_jobs.py` to get help on configuration.

## figures

The summary figures are generated in `hypervolume_comparison.ipynb`, and 
the stats tests are in `stats.ipynb`. 

Pareto front comparisons are generated by `pareto_front_plots.ipynb`.
